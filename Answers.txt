1. If we add class to it, then it will compile and will give output "small x" once.
2. It will compile but as it is a infinite loop, the loop runs continuosly and no output will come.
3. If we add main method to it, then it will compile and gives output and prints "small x" 2 times.
8. It will print "Hello + name".
9. It will compile and give Hello and will give an run time error because no arguments are passed in main 
method and will give array index out of bound exception because we have used args[i] which is args[0] as
i values is 0, there is no value in args[0] to print so it will give exception.
